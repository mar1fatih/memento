Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites

You'll need the following software installed on your machine:

    Git

    Node.js (v18.x or later is recommended)

    npm (Node Package Manager), which comes with Node.js

Installation & Setup

    Clone the repository
    Open your terminal and run the following command:
    Bash

git clone https://github.com/mar1fatih/memento.git

(Note: You will need to replace memento with your actual repository name if it's different.)

Navigate to the project directory
Bash

cd memento

Set up the Backend

    Navigate to the backend folder:
    Bash

cd backend

Install the required npm packages:
Bash

npm install

Create a .env file in the backend directory. You will need to add the following required variables:
Code snippet

    # .env file in the 'backend' directory
    PORT=5000
    MONGODB_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string"
    CLOUD_NAME="your_cloudinary_cloud_name"
    CLOUD_API_KEY="your_cloudinary_api_key"
    CLOUD_API_SECRET="your_cloudinary_api_secret"
    JWT_SECRET="your_strong_secret_for_jwt"

Set up the Frontend

    From the root memento directory, navigate to the frontend folder:
    Bash

cd ../frontend 

Install the required npm packages:
Bash

        npm install

Running the Application

You will need to open two separate terminal windows or tabs to run both the backend and frontend servers simultaneously.

    Start the Backend Server

        In a terminal at the backend directory, run:
        Bash

    npm start

    Your backend API should now be running, typically on http://localhost:5000.

Start the Frontend Development Server

    In another terminal at the frontend directory, run:
    Bash
