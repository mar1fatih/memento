## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:
-   Git
-   Node.js (v18.x or later)
-   npm (which is included with Node.js)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/mar1fatih/memento.git
    cd memento
    ```

2.  **Setup Backend**
    ```sh
    # Navigate into the backend directory
    cd backend

    # Install dependencies
    npm install

    # Create the environment file
    touch .env
    ```
    Now, open the `.env` file and add the following variables with your own credentials:
    ```env
    PORT=5000
    MONGODB_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string"
    CLOUD_NAME="your_cloudinary_cloud_name"
    CLOUD_API_KEY="your_cloudinary_api_key"
    CLOUD_API_SECRET="your_cloudinary_api_secret"
    JWT_SECRET="your_strong_secret_for_jwt"
    ```

3.  **Setup Frontend**
    ```sh
    # Navigate back to the root directory
    cd ..

    # Navigate into the frontend directory
    cd frontend

    # Install dependencies
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

You need to run the backend and frontend in two separate terminals.

-   **Terminal 1: Start the Backend**
    ```sh
    # Make sure you are in the 'backend' directory
    cd backend
    npm start
    ```

-   **Terminal 2: Start the Frontend**
    ```sh
    # Make sure you are in the 'frontend' directory
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```
    Your app should now be running locally! Open your browser to the address shown in the frontend terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).
